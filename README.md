# An Online Form

This is a brief form created as a [front-end project for freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form). I have been chipping away at the freeCodeCamp curriculum for some time, and I find it liberating that I can now use GitHub Pages to host my projects. Codepen just doesn't do it for me.
